 
# ReactNative-TweetCounter

Create a simple textbox that displays how many characters are remaining in the "tweet" to send out (Tweets are 280 characters).

If the characters remaining are equal or more than 10, make the info text light gray. 
If the characters remaining are less than 10, make it Yellow. 
If you exceed the character limit, make the details Red.
